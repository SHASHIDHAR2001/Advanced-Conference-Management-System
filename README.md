## Business Logic and Scripts

### DocTypes Used:
The Frappe app is built around several core DocTypes, each designed to manage different aspects of the conference management system. Here’s how the logic is implemented across the following DocTypes:

### Conferences
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ca61806-8c7c-43ad-b105-c30758bbe5a6)

- **The Conference DocType** holds general information about a conference, including the name, start and end dates, and conference schedule.
- **Business Logic**: Ensures that all session times fall within the conference’s start and end time.

### Session
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c502c8f6-29c7-46b1-b565-624eaa6d9fc7)

- **The Session DocType** stores the session details, including session name, speaker, start time, and end time.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Ensures no session overlaps with another session in the same conference.
  - Verifies that the session start time is earlier than the end time.
  - Ensures that sessions fall within the conference’s time frame.

### Attendee
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daffb696-5dcb-4d81-9ed5-33505ea47bcc)

- **The Attendee DocType** contains information about individuals attending the conference, including their name, email, and the sessions they’re registered for.
- **Business Logic**:
  - If an attendee registers for a session that overlaps with another session they are already registered for, an alert is shown.
  - Preferences for sessions are stored for each attendee.

### Preference
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4bf4714-1671-423d-bf05-98124f611e2f)

- **The Preference DocType** represents an attendee's preferences for sessions. It links to the sessions that an attendee prefers to attend.
- **Business Logic**:
  - This DocType is used to send personalized session recommendations based on the attendee's preferences.

### Registration
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1741f7-af37-44f9-9fef-f5adf2f9b568)

- **The Registration DocType** tracks which sessions an attendee has registered for and their payment status.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Verifies whether a session has reached its seat capacity before allowing a new registration.
  - Updates the payment status when a registration payment is processed. This could include integrating a mock payment function to simulate the payment process.
  - The mock payment function randomly determines the payment status with a 70% chance of success (marked as "Paid") and a 30% chance of failure or pending status (marked as "Failed" or "Pending").

### Apilog
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06eac140-7f0a-46af-b5c4-e9b784ba3d7f)

- **The Apilog DocType** logs API requests and responses, especially for tracking session recommendations and attendee actions.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Logs API calls process, ensuring that system interactions are tracked for debugging and audit purposes.
